**Executive Summary**
Analyzing 10,000 user sessions, the funnel tracks five key stages: ** Homepage Visit → Product View → Add to Cart → Checkout Start → Purchase**. The most significant drop-off  **(30.13%)** occurs between Add to Cart and Checkout Start, with an overall conversion rate of just **14.6%**.
Device analysis shows **tablet users** convert slightly higher **(15.77%)** than **desktop (14.03%)** and **mobile (13.90%)**, though mobile performance still presents an opportunity for improvement.
**Recommendations:**
•	Improve product pages to boost Add to Cart actions.
